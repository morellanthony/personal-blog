			<p>Certified Bug Bounty Hunter by Hack The Box</p>
<p>​<a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/904e5947-ab72-4d9b-bb0f-0ca6ec1df3f7/public_url">​I am a HTB CBBH!</a></p>
<h3 id="review">Review</h3>
<p>A great certification. I would highly recommend the training and exam.</p>
<h4 id="the-training">The Training</h4>
<p>The training for this exam felt amazing at times. I felt like content that I had learned in this path had given me such an advantage in application security. However, there were some modules within the training path that seemed irrelevant and confusing. This doesn&rsquo;t happen often, thankfully.</p>
<h4 id="the-exam">The Exam</h4>
<p>This exam was tough, I have heard of others within the HTB discord compare the difficulty of the CBBH to the OSWE as an equal, and that the OSWA would be considered very easy in comparison. The exam requires critical thinking and a trained eye.
People within the HTB community believe that the course training is all you need, and while I do agree with that, I believe that it takes a trained eye to understand and see certain vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4 id="overall">Overall</h4>
<p>There are some bumps with this exam, and I felt some strong frustrations toward the exam at some moments.
However, the frustration was because of my lack of understanding most of the time. I failed this exam on my first attempt, after feeling defeated I rethought my strategy, studied my feedback, and took the time off to relax from hacking.
After about a week, I took my free retake and got enough points within the first 12 hours to pass.</p>
