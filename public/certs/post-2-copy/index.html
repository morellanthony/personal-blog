<p>​<a href="https://verified.elearnsecurity.com/certificates/c04ac59f-d6eb-4e57-ae91-149f23ee8b28">​I am eJPT certified!</a>
​</p>
<h3 id="review">Review</h3>
<p>This certification was my first attempted certification ever in the field. However, after going through a couple certifications and reviewing other people&rsquo;s experience with their certifications I think this has and may be one of my favorite certifications to take.</p>
<h4 id="the-training">The Training</h4>
<p>INE or eLearnSecurity provides training (at a cost?) for the eJPT. I would say the training within INE is more than enough. However, it is important to take notes as you go through the course as the course does not talk about good note taking methods.</p>
<h4 id="the-exam">The Exam</h4>
<p>The exam was a great experience. The level of difficulty within the exam was just broad and shallow enough. My only comment would be that the networking portion should be studied as it seems like the largest roadblock for testers.</p>
<h4 id="overall">Overall</h4>
<p>This exam was personally a game changer for me. Before committing to the exam, I was rejected for a long and difficult job process that took months of physical conditions, education, and experience to prepare for. I studied for about a month and a half for this exam, and it has helped propel my confidence as a penetration tester today.
For some perspective before the exam, I had about 1 year of experience on TryHackMe and a bachelor’s degree in cyber &amp; IT. Then I took a 9-month break from hacking and began studying for the eJPT.
I would highly recommend this exam due to the price point, time commitment, and level of difficulty for aspiring entry level penetration testers.</p>
