<p>​<a href="https://verified.elearnsecurity.com/certificates/db254803-1426-4b84-926f-72cb19b2422a">​I am eWPT certified!</a>
​</p>
<h1 id="review-elearnsecurity-web-application-penetration-tester-ewpt-certification">Review: eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester (eWPT) Certification</h1>
<p>Over the past few months, I’ve been working to deepen my understanding of web security while completing my master’s in cybersecurity. I wanted a certification that would help me strengthen my skills without adding too much to my already demanding workload. The <strong>eWPT</strong> seemed like a good fit for that purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-training">The Training</h2>
<p>The training for the eWPT aligned well with the exam material. While I found the training content to be fairly basic, I appreciated its focus on reinforcing foundational concepts. Building strong fundamentals is a priority for me as I prepare to tackle more advanced certifications in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-exam">The Exam</h2>
<p>The exam itself, unfortunately, left me with mixed feelings. While the material tested was relevant, the testing environment was buggy, with inconsistencies in the simulations that made the process frustrating at times.</p>
<p>One notable takeaway from this exam was the heavy emphasis on documentation. I found myself spending more time writing and organizing reports than performing technical work. This gave me a valuable new perspective on penetration testing—realizing that much of the job involves clear and thorough documentation, which is just as critical as technical skills.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>Despite the solid training material, I cannot recommend the eWPT certification due to the issues with the exam environment. The experience felt less polished compared to other certifications, such as the <strong>HTB Certified Bug Bounty Hunter (CBBH)</strong>, which offered more comprehensive content and a smoother overall experience.</p>
<p>That said, the eWPT training did reinforce concepts I’d already learned while preparing for the CBBH, making it a good supplementary resource rather than a necessity.</p>
<p>Lastly, a big thanks to the <strong>TCM Penetration Testing Report Template</strong>, which was an excellent resource for organizing my findings during the exam. You can find that template <a href="https://tcm-sec.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>While the eWPT has its merits, I’d recommend considering alternatives for those seeking a more streamlined and rewarding certification experience.</p>
