<p>​<a href="https://verified.elearnsecurity.com/certificates/c04ac59f-d6eb-4e57-ae91-149f23ee8b28">​I am eJPT certified!</a>
​</p>
<h1 id="review-elearnsecurity-junior-penetration-tester-ejpt-certification">Review: eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) Certification</h1>
<p>The <strong>eJPT certification</strong> was my first-ever attempt at a cybersecurity certification. After completing a few more certifications and reflecting on the experiences of others, I can confidently say that the eJPT remains one of my favorite certifications to date.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-training">The Training</h2>
<p>INE (formerly eLearnSecurity) provides the training material for the eJPT. While the training comes at a cost, it is thorough and more than sufficient to prepare for the exam. The course covers a wide range of fundamental topics, making it highly accessible for beginners. However, I strongly recommend taking detailed notes throughout the training, as the material does not emphasize note-taking methods—a skill that can significantly aid both your study process and exam performance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-exam">The Exam</h2>
<p>The exam itself is well-structured and a great experience overall. The difficulty level is broad in scope, covering a variety of foundational concepts, but remains shallow enough to make it approachable for newcomers to the field. One area that stands out is the networking portion, which I found to be the most challenging aspect. I recommend focusing additional time on networking fundamentals during your preparation, as this can be a common roadblock for some testers.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>This certification was a pivotal moment in my cybersecurity journey. Before attempting the eJPT, I faced a lengthy and rigorous job application process that ended in rejection. That experience motivated me to dedicate myself to this certification, and it ultimately helped me rebuild my confidence into penetration testing.</p>
<p>To provide some context on my background:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience:</strong> 1~ year of hands-on learning through TryHackMe</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity &amp; IT</li>
<li><strong>Preparation:</strong> 9-month break from hacking before resuming studies for the eJPT, then 1~ month of daily studying.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exam proved to be an excellent investment of time and effort. The eJPT stands out as a top choice for aspiring entry-level penetration testers due to its:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affordable price point</li>
<li>Reasonable time commitment</li>
<li>Beginner-friendly difficulty level</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly recommend the eJPT to anyone looking to build a strong foundation in penetration testing and advance their career in cybersecurity.</p>
