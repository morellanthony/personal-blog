      <description>&lt;p&gt;Certified Bug Bounty Hunter by Hack The Box&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;​&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.credential.net/11b2cfca-2bf6-4b95-b814-ecb702bbdc5c&#34;&gt;I am a certified PJMT!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;review-tcm-security-practical-mobile-penetration-tester-pmpt-certification&#34;&gt;Review: TCM Security Practical Mobile Penetration Tester (PMPT) Certification&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;PMPT certification&lt;/strong&gt; is a great option for those new to mobile penetration testing. I highly recommend both the training and the exam. However, for individuals with prior experience in mobile testing, this certification may not provide much of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-training&#34;&gt;The Training&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The training for this certification aligns perfectly with the exam material. There are no unexpected surprises, which makes it an excellent resource for beginners. I particularly enjoyed the training, as it introduced me to the fundamentals of hacking mobile applications in a clear and accessible way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It offers significant value for those looking to enhance their skills in application security. I would highly recommend both the training and the exam for those serious about advancing in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-training&#34;&gt;The Training&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The training for the CBBH certification was exceptional in many aspects. The content provided a deep understanding of application security and gave me a significant advantage in identifying vulnerabilities. However, not all modules were equally relevant—some felt confusing or disconnected from the core objectives of the exam. Thankfully, these instances were rare, and the overall quality of the training was excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I wanted a certification that would help me strengthen my skills without adding too much to my already demanding workload. The &lt;strong&gt;eWPT&lt;/strong&gt; seemed like a good fit for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-training&#34;&gt;The Training&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The training for the eWPT aligned well with the exam material. While I found the training content to be fairly basic, I appreciated its focus on reinforcing foundational concepts. Building strong fundamentals is a priority for me as I prepare to tackle more advanced certifications in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>eJPT by INE/eLearnSecurity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;eJPT by eLearnSecurity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;​&lt;a href=&#34;https://verified.elearnsecurity.com/certificates/c04ac59f-d6eb-4e57-ae91-149f23ee8b28&#34;&gt;​I am eJPT certified!&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;​&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;review-elearnsecurity-junior-penetration-tester-ejpt-certification&#34;&gt;Review: eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) Certification&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;eJPT certification&lt;/strong&gt; was my first-ever attempt at a cybersecurity certification. After completing a few more certifications and reflecting on the experiences of others, I can confidently say that the eJPT remains one of my favorite certifications to date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-training&#34;&gt;The Training&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;INE (formerly eLearnSecurity) provides the training material for the eJPT. While the training comes at a cost, it is thorough and more than sufficient to prepare for the exam. The course covers a wide range of fundamental topics, making it highly accessible for beginners. However, I strongly recommend taking detailed notes throughout the training, as the material does not emphasize note-taking methods—a skill that can significantly aid both your study process and exam performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
