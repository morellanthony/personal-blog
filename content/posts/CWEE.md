# Review: Hack The Box Certified Web Exploitation Expert (CWEE) Certification  

The **CWEE certification** is an extremely challenging exam. I hope this review helps readers set better expectation for themselves and avoid any pitfalls I made while taking the exam.

## The Training  

The training for the CWEE certification was outstanding in many ways, however it was also very incomplete in other ways. At the time I took the training I started in late December of 2023 and went until early May of 2024. I started the training as it was actively being released. This was my first mistake because, modules end up changing as I would progress.
You may also notice that from the time I completed my training to my exam there is almost a year gap of time. This is because I did the CPTS path, and BSCP path & exam, then went back to review the CWEE path. While I don't regret the BSCP path, the time away from the exam material, hurt. Bad. This has made me a believer into not waiting to take an exam too long after finishing its proclaimed course. The BSCP path didn't take me as long, but the CPTS path did, and I should've have avoided it entirely to study more white box material. 
Speaking of which, While the course path contained a lot of outstanding information to digest, I do not think it was complete, for me at least. You must consider your skill set when attempting these things. In short here is my best thought to supplementing the path.
* Black box: Portswigger Academy
* White box: Pentester Lab
It is critical to continue understanding how to exploit black box vulnerabilities. While at this point I think most people feel comfortable here if they're taking this exam.
For the white box however, I wish I would have had a better resource to prepare at the time, and that is simply my own fault and limited exposure. I recently started doing some of the code reviews in Pentester Lab, and I wish I would have started it concurrently with the BSCP or CWEE path.

## The Exam  

The CWEE exam is a nightmare level exam. To be transparent, at the time of writing I would'nt consider myself an 'expert', I know I have a lot more to learn in this field. With that noted, I would consider myself a mid level web penetration tester/application security specialist. I am sure if I continue to spend more time programming and code reviewing from when I took this exam, my difficulty in the exam would change.

## Overall  

The CWEE certification is tough. I hope I do not scare people away with this information, and know that everyone's experience may not be the same. If you a more seasoned web security specialist then I am sure it will still be tough, just not as tough I am making it out to be. I have about 3 years in application security, and less than a year of real web pentests under my belt. Keep this in perspective as you journey along and good luck to those who take it and do not feel ashamed if you fail it (seriously).
