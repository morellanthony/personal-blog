# Review: Hack The Box Certified Web Exploitation Expert (CWEE) Certification

The **CWEE certification** is an extremely challenging exam. I hope this review helps readers set better expectations for themselves and avoid any pitfalls I made while taking the exam.

## The Training

The training for the CWEE certification was outstanding in many ways; however, it was also very incomplete in other ways. At the time I took the training, I started in late December of 2023 and went until early May of 2024. I started the training as it was actively being released. This was my first mistake because modules ended up changing as I progressed.

You may also notice that from the time I completed my training to my exam, there is almost a year gap. This is because I did the CPTS path, and the BSCP path & exam, then went back to review the CWEE path. While I don't regret the BSCP path, the time away from the exam material hurt. Bad. This has made me a believer in **not** waiting too long to take an exam after finishing its proclaimed course. The BSCP path didn't take me as long, but the CPTS path did, and I **should've avoided the CPTS path entirely** to study more white box material.  
Speaking of which, while the course path contained a lot of outstanding information to digest, I do not think it was complete... for me at least. You must consider your skill set when attempting these things. In short, here is my best thought to supplementing the path:

* **Black box**: PortSwigger Academy  
* **White box**: PentesterLab

It is critical to continue understanding how to exploit black box vulnerabilities. At this point, I think most people feel comfortable here if they're taking this exam.  
For the white box, however, I wish I had a better resource to prepare at the time, which that is simply my own fault limiting my exposure. I recently started doing some of the code reviews in PentesterLab, and I should have started it concurrently with the BSCP or CWEE path.

## The Exam

The CWEE exam is a nightmare-level exam. To be transparent, at the time of writing I wouldn't consider myself an "expert" as I know I have a lot more to learn in this field. That said, I would consider myself a mid-level web penetration tester/application security specialist. I'm sure if I continue to spend more time programming and code reviewing from when I took this exam, my difficulty with the exam would change.

## Overall

The CWEE certification is tough and I am beyond thrilled that I was able to pass this exam. I hope I don’t scare people away with this information as everyone’s experience may not be the same. If you're a more seasoned web security specialist, then I’m sure it will still be tough, just not as tough as I’m making it out to be. I have about three years in application security, and less than a year of real web pentests under my belt. Keep this in perspective as you journey along, and good luck to those who take it. Do not feel ashamed if you fail this exam, as even finishing out the path deserves a great deal of respect.
