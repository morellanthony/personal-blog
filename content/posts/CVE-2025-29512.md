# Steps

1. **Create a normal user** and **promote or ensure the user is a moderator**.  
2. Navigate to `/ip-blacklist`.  
3. Enter the payload `</textarea><script>alert(“NodeBB Hacked!”)</script>`.  
4. Click the **"Apply Blacklist"** button.  
5. Refresh the page and observe the **XSS Proof of Concept (PoC)**.

6. Once you navigate back to the page, the **script tags will be embedded into the page**.  
   - To *possibly* remove the tags, simply click the **"Apply Blacklist"** button again with an **arbitrary IP value**.  

7. **Side note:** You can also **deny access to this page** with other **HTML injection attacks**.  
   I found two ways to remove the injected data:  
   1. Host another page I never reloaded that had the **"Apply Blacklist"** button. This would be used to **cleanse** the endpoint of any injections.  
   2. Manually delete the `ip-blacklist-rules` field in the **MongoDB database**:  

      ```
      db.objects.deleteOne({ _key: "ip-blacklist-rules" });
      ```

   - There appears to be **no built-in way** to remove the script tags once embedded into the `<textarea>`, and the **API does not manage IP blacklists**.  
   - As a result of attempting **CSRF attacks**, every time I navigated to the page, I could not make changes and encountered the following issue:

# Further Analysis: Code Review  

Exploiting a vulnerability is one thing, but understanding the design and the fix for the issue is an entirely different skill.  

After reporting the vulnerability to the security team, the developers chose to mitigate the issue by incorporating the `validator` npm package. This package includes a function called `validator.escape`. According to the npm documentation, the `escape` function performs the following transformation:  

| **Function** | **Description** |  
|--------------|-----------------|  
| `escape(input)` | replace <, >, &, ', " and / with HTML entities. |  

---

## The Fix  

The developers passed the user-provided `rules` data through `validator.escape` to sanitize it. Additionally, the data was wrapped with the `String()` function to ensure it is always converted to a string data type.  

`src/controllers/globalmods.js`
```js
'use strict';

const validator = require('validator');
const user = require('../user');
const meta = require('../meta');
const analytics = require('../analytics');

res.render('ip-blacklist', {
		title: '[[pages:ip-blacklist]]',
		rules: validator.escape(String(rules)),
		analytics: analyticsData,
		breadcrumbs: helpers.buildBreadcrumbs([{ text: '[[pages:ip-blacklist]]' }]),
	});
```
