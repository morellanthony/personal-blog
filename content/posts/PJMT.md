# Review: TCM Security Practical Mobile Penetration Tester (PMPT) Certification  

The **PMPT certification** is a great option for those new to mobile penetration testing. I highly recommend both the training and the exam. However, for individuals with prior experience in mobile testing, this certification may not provide much of a challenge.

## The Training  

The training for this certification aligns perfectly with the exam material. There are no unexpected surprises, which makes it an excellent resource for beginners. I particularly enjoyed the training, as it introduced me to the fundamentals of hacking mobile applications in a clear and accessible way.

## The Exam  

The exam was straightforward and likely the easiest certification exam I’ve completed to date. Aaron (the course and exam creator) has stated that only the Android portion of the training is needed to pass, and I can confirm this to be true. The allotted time for both the exam and the accompanying report is more than sufficient, making it a smooth and stress-free process.

## Overall  

This certification is an excellent introduction to mobile penetration testing, especially for beginners. The combination of training and exam is designed to comfortably ease learners into the world of mobile application security.  

From start to finish, it took me a total of 9 days to complete the training and pass the exam. While prior knowledge of basic **Burp Suite** functions and very basic web application vulnerabilities may be helpful, it isn’t strictly necessary to succeed.  

For those looking to break into mobile security, the **PMPT certification** is a great starting point.
