# About Me  

My name is Anthony, but you can call me Tony. I’m a cybersecurity professional with a strong passion for web security and a relentless curiosity for uncovering vulnerabilities. This blog serves as a platform to share my experiences with exploits, bug bounty hunting, and experimental cybersecurity research.  

While I enjoy tackling Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, many of these accomplishments have already been well-documented by others. My goal with this blog is to contribute unique, high-quality material that adds value to the cybersecurity community.  

> I’m currently transitioning from my previous blog, as I felt it reflected a more entry-level perspective. Over time, my approach to penetration testing and cybersecurity has evolved, and I aim to take a less conventional path. Many cybersecurity blogs today focus on beginner-to-intermediate CTF walkthroughs and certification reviews—content that has its merits but can feel repetitive. While I still value certifications and CTFs, my ambition is to elevate this blog into a space that prioritizes originality, critical thinking, and advanced research.  
Here, you can expect to find content like:

>- Creative, high-quality home lab demonstrations  
>- Challenging certifications and CTFs that go beyond the basics  
>- Insights into bug bounty programs and potential CVE discoveries 

>For those interested, my previous blog is still available here: [Anthony's Blog](https://morell-tony.gitbook.io/home). My hope is to retire this statement from this new blog, as this continues to evolve into a hub for meaningful contributions to the field of cybersecurity.
