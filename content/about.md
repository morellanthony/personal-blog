# About Me  

My name is Anthony, but you can call me Tony. I’m a offensive security consultant with a strong passion for web applications, internal networks, social engineering, Wi-Fi, and physical security, and red teaming. I also have a deep curiosity for uncovering vulnerabilities. This blog serves as a platform to share my experiences industry experiences, bug bounty hunting, and experimental cybersecurity research.  

While I enjoy tackling Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, many of these accomplishments have already been well-documented by others. My goal with this blog is to contribute unique, high-quality material that adds value to the cybersecurity community.
